## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately segment buildings from satellite imagery using Mamba, a high-performance computer vision framework. The Massachusetts Buildings dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluation.

Key highlights of this project include:
- Preprocessing satellite images for segmentation.
- Training a segmentation model using the Mamba framework.
- Visualizing results and evaluating model performance.

## Features

- **High Accuracy:** Leverages Mamba's advanced features for precise segmentation.
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable to other datasets or segmentation tasks.
- **Visualization Tools:** Includes utilities to visualize segmentation results.
- **Efficient Training:** Optimized for performance with Jupyter Notebook and Python scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Idk507/Segmentation_With_Mamba_for_MassachusettsBuildings.git
   cd Segmentation_With_Mamba_for_MassachusettsBuildings
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure you have the Massachusetts Buildings dataset downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory (see [Dataset](#dataset) for more details).

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Run the provided notebooks to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate results.

3. Customize the parameters and configurations in the Python scripts or notebooks to adapt the project to your needs.

## Dataset

This project uses the Massachusetts Buildings dataset, which contains labeled satellite images for building segmentation tasks. 

- [Massachusetts Buildings Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/data/)  
  Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory within this repository.

Please ensure that you comply with the dataset's terms of use.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in segmenting buildings, as demonstrated by the visualizations and evaluation metrics provided in the results notebook. Example outputs and performance metrics will be displayed in the `results/` directory after running the evaluation scripts.
